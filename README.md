# DungeonOfForgottenDreams

A 2D Pixel Art RPG Rogue-lite game created as a small side solo project to learn how to use GameMaker Studio 2 for other projects.

This program was written following a tutorial by Shaun Spalding[1]. However it does not completely follow their tutorial, this is to add my own personal spin to the project.

All sprite work are my own, please do not use them with my explict consent.
