# DungeonOfForgottenDreams

A 2D Pixel Art RPG Rogue-lite game created as a small side solo project to learn how to use GameMaker Studio 2 for other projects.

This program was written following a tutorial by Shaun Spalding. However it does not completely follow their tutorial, this is to add my own personal spin to the project.

Please note: The code is (mostly) not mine as I've been following the tutorial by Shaun Spalding on YouTube: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPRT_JORnIuosvhfax2TQTEmN7OYTcSvK

All sprite work are my own, please do not use them with my explict consent.
