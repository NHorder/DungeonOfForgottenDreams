# DungeonOfForgottenDreams

A 2D Pixel Art RPG Rogue-lite game created as a small side solo project to learn how to use GameMaker Studio 2 for other projects.

Please note: The code is (mostly) not mine as I've been following the tutorial by Shaun Spalding on YouTube: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPRT_JORnIuosvhfax2TQTEmN7OYTcSvK

However, all the sprite assets are mine and should not be used without my written consent.
